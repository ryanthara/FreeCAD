# Examples

This folder contains example files created with FreeCAD.

As every FreeCAD user my journey to FreeCAD started with
the attempt to use only one, or two workbenches, but the
power of FreeCAd is unleashed through the use of several
workbenches in a structured way.

Therefore there are less special single workbench related
content.
